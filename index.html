    <h2>Database Structures</h2>
    <p>A database is an organized collection of data. Instead of having all the data in a list with a random order, a database provides a structure to organize the data.<br /><br /> There are <strong>four</strong> structural types of database management systems</p>
    <h3>These are the four types</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hierarchical databases</li>
      <li>Network databases</li>
      <li>Relational databases</li>
      <li>Object-oriented databases</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The meaning of databases</h3>
    <p>A database management system is a software tool that makes it possible to organize data in a database. It is often referred to by its acronym, DBMS. The functions of a DBMS include concurrency, security, backup and recovery, integrity and data descriptions.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Databases</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Better Access To Data</h3></li>
      <p> A management system helps in getting quick solutions to database queries, and therefore, data access is faster and more accurate. End users like sales people will have enhanced access to the data, enabling a faster sales cycle and a more sound decision making process. </p>
      <li><h3>Data Sharing Is Improved In The Organization</h3></li>
      <p>Proper database management systems help in gaining better access to data as well as better management of the data. In turn, better access helps the end users share the data fast and effectively across the organization.</p>
      <li><h3>Effective Data Integration</h3></li>
      <p> When data management is improved, it promotes an integrated picture of an organizationâ€™s operations. It becomes easy to see how operations in one segment of the organization affects other segments of the organization. Thus, effective integration of data is accomplished through the use of data management solutions.</p>
      <li><h3>Database Management Systems Minimize Data Inconsistency</h3></li>
      <p> Data inconsistency occurs when different versions of data exist in different places in an organization. By using a proper management system and data quality management tools, the problem of data inconsistency is minimized. </p>
      <li><h3>Increase In Productivity Of The End User</h3></li>
      <p>By deploying the best data quality tools and database management systems, the productivity of the end user is increased. With the data management tools, the end users are empowered to make quick and informed decisions that can decide the success and failure of a company in a long run.</p>
      <li><h3>Quick Decision Making</h3></li>
      <p>When data is better managed and access is improved, quality information is generated and the user is enabled to make faster decisions. A good database managing system helps in providing a framework to facilitate data quality initiatives and in turn, higher quality information helps in making better, faster decisions in an organization.</p>
